have ‘50 years of world sporting action on film, 50 of our greatest sporting stars – in the
studio during the series’ by the Radio times. This has definitely been accomplished as it is
now one the world’s longest running tv sports quizzes filming 1,285 episodes over 50 series,
having over 3,000 different sporting stars appear on the show such as Jessica Ennis Hill,
Denise Lewis, Chris Hoy, Anthony Joshua, Martina Navratilova, Michael Owen and Sebastian
Coe along with many others. As well as a very special appearance from Princess Anne on the
200 th episode attracting an audience of over 19 million viewers.
