## **IS THIS YOU?**

* A TV and design lover?
* You want to know more about the behind the scenes in why a TV show chooses particular designs and themes?
* Interested in the history and development of programmes through the ages?

Me Too! Hopefully you will enjoy scrolling through and learn something new!

## **ABOUT THE SITE**

This is a place to learn more about TV and Design, a place to learn more about the behind the scenes in why a TV show chooses particuler designs and themes and to delve deep into the history and development of programmes through the ages.

My goals for this site is it to be a place for people to feed their curiosity on the reasons behind why you are attracted to a certain tv programme and the thoughts gone into creating a specific brand. As well as the adaptation that have taken place over a number of years. 

Many aren't even aware of what draws them to certain programmes and what captivates them in hopes that they keep watching. this site is a place for people to explore that side of the TV industry and help them in their own research.

So if you’re a TV and little bit of a history buff like I am, you’ve come to the right place.
